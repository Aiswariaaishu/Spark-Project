# Spark-Project
## Project Title: Spark Analysis of COVID-19 Data for PHU Locations in Canada<br />
Overview: This project presents a functional Spark analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on Public Health Unit (PHU) locations and cases across Canada. Leveraging the power of Apache Spark, the analysis provides efficient and scalable processing of large datasets to derive valuable insights into the pandemic's impact.<br />
Key Features:<br />
Functional Programming Approach: The Spark analysis is implemented using a functional programming paradigm, emphasizing the use of filter, groupby operations for clear and concise code.<br />
PHU Location Insights: Explore and analyze COVID-19 data at the PHU level, gaining insights into regional variations, trends, and patterns.<br />
Data Transformation: Efficiently transform dataset into dataframe and preprocess raw COVID-19 data to extract relevant information for analysis, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.<br />
Scalability with Spark: Leverage the distributed computing capabilities of Apache Spark for handling large-scale datasets, enabling faster and more efficient processing.<br />
Dataset Details: The dataset encompasses COVID-19 data for PHU locations in Canada, featuring information on cases, trends, and other relevant metrics. The structured data enables in-depth analysis and visualization.<br />
